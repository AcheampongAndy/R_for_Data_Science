# VII Data Wrangle: dplyr for relational data

## Assignment

Create R script for each exercise. In given exercises we will use nycflights13 database.

## Exercise 1
* In the first exercise we would like to inspect, if carriers use different type of planes:
	* we would like to see the distribution of planes per manufacturer for each carrier
	* first, add plane info and carrier name to flights table
	* second, count number of different planes, break down by manufacturer for each carrier (you can also add number of flights)
	* lastly, create a bar plot (manufacturer on x-axis, number of planes on y-axis, bar fill color is defined by carrier)

## Exercise 2
In the second exercise we would like to use data and try to answer the following question: ”Do weather conditions have affect on flight arrival delay time?”

Here you have more freedom, choose the data you want and use the plot you think is the most adequate, for answering the question.
