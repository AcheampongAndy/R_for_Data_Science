About tibble and readr
tibble
tibble is a user-friendly way to handle data in R. When you use it, only a few rows show up on the screen, which is handy when dealing with big datasets. It also plays well with other tidyverse tools like dplyr for easy data manipulation.

readr
readr is like a superhero for reading data in R. Its functions, such as read_csv() and read_table(), work faster than the basic R ones. They're smart tooâ€”they figure out the types of your data columns on their own. This makes bringing in data way simpler and quicker.

Together, tibble and readr team up to make handling and reading data in R a breeze!
