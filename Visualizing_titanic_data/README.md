Based on an analysis of the Titanic dataset, I examined various factors related to the passengers' survival on the ill-fated ship. The dataset provided information about the passengers' demographics, ticket class, cabin location, family relationships, and more. By applyin visualization, and statistical techniques, I aimed to gain insights into the factors that influenced survival rates. The analysis uncovered intriguing patterns, such as the significant impact of passenger class and gender on survival.
